you gonna have to copy paste the skin pack's ships folder in graphics/ORA/ into the 
Graphics/*Skin Name*/ folder in this mod.

aka from *skin pack*/Graphics/ORA/ to CPW Mod/Graphics/*Skin Name*/
make sure you got the skin pack in tho or else ERRORS.

also there's an Icon for the Skin Pack in the Graphics/icons Folder.
