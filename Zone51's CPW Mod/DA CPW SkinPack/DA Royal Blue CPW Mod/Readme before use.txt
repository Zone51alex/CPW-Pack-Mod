you gonna have to copy paste the skin pack's ships folder in *Skin Name*/graphics/DA/ into the 
Graphics/*Skin Name*/ folder in this mod.

aka from *Skin Name*/Graphics/DA/ to CPW Mod/Graphics/*Skin Name*/
make sure you got the skin pack in tho or else ERRORS.

also there's an Icon for the Skin Pack in the Graphics/icons Folder.
