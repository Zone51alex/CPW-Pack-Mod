you gonna have to copy paste the skin pack's ships folder in graphics/*skin name*/ into the 
Graphics/*Skin Name*/ folder in this mod.

aka from *skin pack*/Graphics/*skin Name*/ to CPW Mod/Graphics/*Skin Name*/
make sure you got the skin pack in tho or else ERRORS.

OH WAIT ITS MY OWN Sprite Stop reading and Plop that stuff in !

also there's an Icon for the Skin Pack in the Graphics/icons Folder.
a Leftover from my 0.95 Paintjob Mod.
